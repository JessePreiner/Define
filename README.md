# Define
Small console app for defining words and spitting definitions to standard out


# Building
Will require working app_id and app_key for use with the `od-api.oxforddictionaries.com` API. Add these keys in a secretSettings.config file, build with MSBuild and you should be good to go.

# Usage
Move define.exe to somewhere in your path, and run:
  ```define <any> <number> <of> <words>```
